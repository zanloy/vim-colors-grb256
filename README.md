#vim-colors-grb256

## Summary

This is a vim colorscheme that was originally developed by
[Gary Bernhardt](https://github.com/garybernhardt). This repo is just to port
the colorscheme to bundle format for easy installation.

## Install

If you do not already use a vim bundler, I recommend
[pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

To install with pathogen:

```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/zanloy/vim-colors-grb256.git
```

To use this colorscheme, add the following line to ~/.vimrc

```
colorscheme grb256
```

To switch to this colorscheme while editing a file:

```
:colo grb256
```

## Acknolegements

This colorscheme was not developed by me. You can find the original
[here](https://github.com/garybernhardt/dotfiles/blob/master/.vim/colors/grb256.vim).
I only ported it to different format for easy installation using a vim bundler.
